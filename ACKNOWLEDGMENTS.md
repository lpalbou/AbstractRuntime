# Acknowledgments

AbstractRuntime is designed to pair with the wider Abstract ecosystem and the open-source Python tooling community.

Thanks to:
- **AbstractCore** — provides the LLM/tool integration used by the optional `abstractruntime[abstractcore]` extra (see `docs/integrations/abstractcore.md`).
- **abstractsemantics** — provides structured schema references used by the runtime (see `pyproject.toml`).
- Everyone who has reported bugs, discussed design tradeoffs, and contributed improvements.
